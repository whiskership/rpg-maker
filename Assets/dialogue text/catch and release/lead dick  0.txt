hey!!


i need you to get those 
customers orders into the
box.
it's really important!!


you should do it with all
your soul and as fast as
possible and as if it was
the most important thing
in your life.

because guess what!?


it is motherfucker.


this is your fucking job
and you should be grateful
to be able to repeat the
same action over and over
again for 8 hours straight
and not talking to any of
your co workers and having
all the higher ups breathing
down you neck for any small
mistake.


you should be grateful you 
little punk ass motherfucker.
